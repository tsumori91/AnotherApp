# AnotherApp
This is a mobile app powered by React Native and packaged/testrun through expo. It is meant as a mobile form of the wiki for the game Another Eden that can help players track their progress and get valuable information about units and equipment.

To run the app you should simply need to install all the dependencies with an npm install, but for testing expo is used and recommended.
